Good phone-could have been better !","I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",19 December 2022

A mildly perfect phone","I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",12 January 2023

Nice 5G phone at a decent price","I loved the colour (sky blue), which looked exceptional when I opened it. Just started using it so cannot comment much on the performance. My mom always used Samsung before, and is fairly comfortable with the change of brand. She is using this since couple of weeks without concerns, but could have had better features at this price. This probably can only fit 2 SIM cards or 1 SIM and 1 SD card, that was surprising. Camera quality does not look great even though the brand claims to have higher MP camera's. Both SIM slots are mentioned 5G, which is great and battery quality so far looks reasonable.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 2 April 2023

Is one plus CE 2 lite a good phone?","After using this phone a few months ago I feel like it is very good even though I used other phones like Vivo and Samsung. In my opinion this phone is very good in both gaming performance and charging battery faster. When talking about camera, it is very decent for a phone under this price but ultra wide is missing which is a drawback. Also its display is LCD display instead of amoled display. Indeed 5G with extra fast internet connection like Airtel 5G. Note that this phone is a sub products from a company called Oppo. That means if you used realme, oppo or even any Chinese phone. It will be the same only. Atlast it depends on your preferences whether Chinese,Indian or American smart phone ,it all depends on you. Whether you choose a flagship phone or just a moderate phone like One plus CE 2 lite.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 18 May 2023

Am very disappoint with camera quality.I chose this to buy bcuz of camera and battery, but my experience is not good with this.Other phone are also coming with good quality...If you want to go for brand, go for it,But in the other brand you can get more good mobiles .",28 March 2023

Budget friendly reliable phone","I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.",5 February 2023

 Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",26 February 2022

Good Product","Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",24 March 2023

Not as expected","I bought this mobile for the purpose of camera, calculator , calling and audio purpose but if i compare with nokia 6.1 plus then it is not as expected.1. First image is nokia 6.1 plus and second is one plus nord ce 2 on same day.2. The quality of Audio while listening music or capture video is not as expected, i guess nokia 6.1 plus audio is better than this mobile.3. Some time auto stopped while listening music.4. Connect to call is awesome 5/5 for this purpose.5. Calculator is awesome for researcher purpose.6. During day time heating problem while taking pictures or making video, i observe nokia 6.1 plus is all time cool, nokia has big issue- software problems, charger problems, jack problems otherwise nokia is better than Apple.7. Battery is awesome better than nokia or other mobile phone but drain very fast even not using internet connection.8. Look is awesome but bigger than hand so may be fall during call.9. one plus gave cover free of cost but there is no protection for camera.10. If you are searching data from your SD slot then it is very slow even data is only 200mb , but nokia is very fast even data is more than 128 gb.Over all this is not as expected (5/10) because data consuming more than other mobile even we never use any social media apps.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 9 April 2023

A good choice for upgrade","Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn't great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.",27 February 2022

Average Phone. So keep average expectations.","Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",28 February 2022

Android Auto Doesn't Work || UPI Apps don't work on Roaming","Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.Severely disappointed.",8 November 2022

Mid ranger Flagship.",I got this mobile for ₹ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ₹3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ₹20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 27 February 2022

Best for elderly people","Bought in big billion day sale but towards the end. My experience is when Amazon takes time in delivering a product, it will be worth it because they push bad product line in starting and immediate delivery. Gifted my mother (58years), and for an elderly person, this phone is perfect.I was initially confused whether to buy this then went for it after reading reviews that its good for elderly person.I setup the phone before giving to my mother. And I am using oneplus6t constantly since may 2019. So oneplus nord ce 2 lite felt like a power in hand. Super fluid, battery, camera, features.Although I would not recommend this phone for youngsters, but its ok if you want a budget power filled smartphone.",8 November 2022

Decent phone","Bought this phone at 22K inr. So consider this price for my review.Camera is hit and miss. Sometime it takes amazing shot, sometimes it just fumbles.EIS with 1080p60 is amazing. You will capture more videos than expected.UI: Coming from MIUI. Its very easy for me to say Oxygen OS is amazing. No debate in thatBattery: Amazing, will change how you use your phone. 15 minute is enough for 4 hours of use. It gives so peace of mind, once you tried it you wont be able to live without it.FP sensor is okay not as snappy as side or rear one but still work fine. You wont notice it.Feel: Super Slippery buy a rugged case immediately. Amazing to look at like. But feels delicate.Price: for 22K its a steal. For original price add little more to get Nord 2T, Poco F4, Nothing phone(1) all these phone are affordable flagship.This phone is just a mid-range phone and should cost 22K for 25 you are better off with spending little more and get those above mentioned phones.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 7 July 2022

If you're keeping your brightness level at the lowest then you won't be able to see things properly in the night also.And outdoor you have to keep the brightness high.Which will affect your battery backup.*TIll now I have faced only one issue, which is brightness.

Few points i would like to clarify:•For people who are upgrading from redmi or other middle budget phones i will say my experience is quite good in that respect•battery life- i fully charged, played an hour of apex legends n genshin impact it went down to 93% with a mild warm back and on a minimal use the charge lasted about a day. But with moderate or more use it lasts about 10-12 hrs which is good enough.•camera - not quite great that is you wont expect this from oneplus but in this range I'll give it a solid 3/5.• audio, video, wireless connectivity all seemed very smooth.•Design-wise it's not exactly premium looking but not totally badRest will again review after a month.",6 June 2022

It has a 3.5mm earphone jack (no earphone is provided within the box) happy to see in OnePlus Brand.Design 4.5/5Performance 4.7/5Battery life 4.8/5Sound 4.8/5Camera 4.5/5Fingerprint response 4.8/5Front camera 4.5/5Overall 4.7/5It's an amazing mobile phone, if anybody wants to buy a 20,000/- range mobile phone then it's the best I can say.Received good packaging from Amazon.in without any damage and happy to receive a good mobile phone from Darshita Electronics.Thank you Amazon.in and Darshita Electronics had a great experience.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 May 2022

Better option available for the price","the phone was not as expected from One Plus.camera is ok-okover all touch and feel id finebiggest drawback is that while on call, the screen does not closes many times because of which the phone goes on mute on every call in the middle of the call",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 22 May 2023

Average phone.. not very influential","Edited after one week.Drawbacks : 1. In-display fingerint is slow as compared to my previous vivo z1x phone.2. Apps crashing some times.3. Sometimes feeling touch issues.4*. Ghost touch experienced on top status bar.5. apps don't remain in background after sometimes , if you open they start again before beginning with fresh start. It is not acceptable with ""mutitasking smartphones"".Good At: 1. Flawless with screen 90hz refresh rate.2. Camera quality is good.3. Light and sleak phone. Feels premium in handNot a recommended buy.",27 September 2022

Overall okay but it can't beat camera quality of oppo","Biggest mistake was to order at Amazon. I myself went at Amazon depot to receive it because delivery boy was not ready to come at 6 pm. Return is most complicated in Amazon. They fixed appointment with technician yesterday and there is no call till now. Flipkart is best to handle quality issues...Amazon broke my trust this time...it's okay for shopping upto 500/-.Camera quality is average. Battery is 4500 only but good thing is charging is very fast. Back cover provided by oneplus is white coloured which masks the appearance of mobile.Moreover, i will use it not more than 6 months due to Camera quality.....which is a little disappointing if you have used Oppo..",19 July 2022

Camera quality is also good n the design of phone is also sleek and if u get fed up using samsung phone n want to switch to other brand I think one plus is far good option to go with only the thing I don't lyk is it comes wid Android 11 but at this price range many companies are giving 12 but we can ignore this thing too n comparing this wid moto edge 30 still I can say OnePlus works better.,24 June 2022

Overall nice phone","Battery life is good, easily lasts a day for my usage, with frequent chat updates, some music playing, once or twice camera usage etc.Display quality, photo quality, sound quality are all above average.However, a bug that disappointed me is that the fingerprint sensor doesn't turn on even in always on display mode. And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered. Pathetic, I'd say.Worse still is, as understood from the OnePlus community website, the bug is known to the developers, but they've been unable to bring an resolution to this issue till now.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 22 April 2022
