0,4.0,Good phone-could have been better !,"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",19 December 2022
1,4.0,A mildly perfect phone,"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",12 January 2023

77,4.0,Nice 5G phone at a decent price,"I loved the colour (sky blue), which looked exceptional when I opened it. Just started using it so cannot comment much on the performance. My mom always used Samsung before, and is fairly comfortable with the change of brand. She is using this since couple of weeks without concerns, but could have had better features at this price. This probably can only fit 2 SIM cards or 1 SIM and 1 SD card, that was surprising. Camera quality does not look great even though the brand claims to have higher MP camera's. Both SIM slots are mentioned 5G, which is great and battery quality so far looks reasonable.",2 April 2023

79,5.0,Is one plus CE 2 lite a good phone?,"After using this phone a few months ago I feel like it is very good even though I used other phones like Vivo and Samsung. In my opinion this phone is very good in both gaming performance and charging battery faster. When talking about camera, it is very decent for a phone under this price but ultra wide is missing which is a drawback. Also its display is LCD display instead of amoled display. Indeed 5G with extra fast internet connection like Airtel 5G. Note that this phone is a sub products from a company called Oppo. That means if you used realme, oppo or even any Chinese phone. It will be the same only. Atlast it depends on your preferences whether Chinese,Indian or American smart phone ,it all depends on you. Whether you choose a flagship phone or just a moderate phone like One plus CE 2 lite.",18 May 2023

Am very disappoint with camera quality.I chose this to buy bcuz of camera and battery, but my experience is not good with this.Other phone are also coming with good quality...If you want to go for brand, go for it,But in the other brand you can get more good mobiles .",28 March 2023

No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.",5 February 2023

¬†Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",26 February 2022

102,4.0,Good Product,"Great device, but as One-entry-level plus's offering, there are some minor flaws that will be obvious. The first issue is the perplexing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily phone handling can be aggravating, with fingers locking and unlocking the phone as you try to handle it and place it in your pockets. Although this is not a major issue, it is something to consider. The second point is that there is some lag here and there (only a minor amount), which I am hoping will go away with future updates/improvements.",24 March 2023

During day time heating problem while taking pictures or making video, i observe nokia 6.1 plus is all time cool, nokia has big issue- software problems, charger problems, jack problems otherwise nokia is better than Apple.7.

Look is awesome but bigger than hand so may be fall during call.9. one plus gave cover free of cost but there is no protection for camera.10.

166,5.0,A good choice for upgrade,"Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn't great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.",27 February 2022

206,3.0,Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",28 February 2022

245,2.0,Android Auto Doesn't Work || UPI Apps don't work on Roaming,"Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.Severely disappointed.",8 November 2022

258,5.0,Mid ranger Flagship.,I got this mobile for ‚Çπ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ‚Çπ3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ‚Çπ20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.,27 February 2022

And I am using oneplus6t constantly since may 2019. So oneplus nord ce 2 lite felt like a power in hand.

You will capture more videos than expected.UI: Coming from MIUI. Its very easy for me to say Oxygen OS is amazing. No debate in thatBattery: Amazing, will change how you use your phone. 15 minute is enough for 4 hours of use. It gives so peace of mind, once you tried it you wont be able to live without it.FP sensor is okay not as snappy as side or rear one but still work fine. You wont notice it.Feel: Super Slippery buy a rugged case immediately. Amazing to look at like. But feels delicate.Price: for 22K its a steal. For original price add little more to get Nord 2T, Poco F4, Nothing phone(1) all these phone are affordable flagship.This phone is just a mid-range phone and should cost 22K for 25 you are better off with spending little more and get those above mentioned phones.",7 July 2022

Flipkart is best to handle quality issues...Amazon broke my trust this time...it's okay for shopping upto 500/-.Camera quality is average. Battery is 4500 only but good thing is charging is very fast. Back cover provided by oneplus is white coloured which masks the appearance of mobile.Moreover, i will use it not more than 6 months due to Camera quality.....which is a little disappointing if you have used Oppo..",19 July 2022

And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered. Pathetic, I'd say.Worse still is, as understood from the OnePlus community website, the bug is known to the developers, but they've been unable to bring an resolution to this issue till now.",22 April 2022

550,4.0,Good phone-could have been better !,"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",19 December 2022
551,4.0,A mildly perfect phone,"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",12 January 2023

627,4.0,Nice 5G phone at a decent price,"I loved the colour (sky blue), which looked exceptional when I opened it. Just started using it so cannot comment much on the performance. My mom always used Samsung before, and is fairly comfortable with the change of brand. She is using this since couple of weeks without concerns, but could have had better features at this price. This probably can only fit 2 SIM cards or 1 SIM and 1 SD card, that was surprising. Camera quality does not look great even though the brand claims to have higher MP camera's. Both SIM slots are mentioned 5G, which is great and battery quality so far looks reasonable.",2 April 2023

629,5.0,Is one plus CE 2 lite a good phone?,"After using this phone a few months ago I feel like it is very good even though I used other phones like Vivo and Samsung. In my opinion this phone is very good in both gaming performance and charging battery faster. When talking about camera, it is very decent for a phone under this price but ultra wide is missing which is a drawback. Also its display is LCD display instead of amoled display. Indeed 5G with extra fast internet connection like Airtel 5G. Note that this phone is a sub products from a company called Oppo. That means if you used realme, oppo or even any Chinese phone. It will be the same only. Atlast it depends on your preferences whether Chinese,Indian or American smart phone ,it all depends on you. Whether you choose a flagship phone or just a moderate phone like One plus CE 2 lite.",18 May 2023

Am very disappoint with camera quality.I chose this to buy bcuz of camera and battery, but my experience is not good with this.Other phone are also coming with good quality...If you want to go for brand, go for it,But in the other brand you can get more good mobiles .",28 March 2023

No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.",5 February 2023

You have to make changes in the basic settings for it to become less technical and more usage friendly, like keypad. Battery is not draining fast but charges fast. The adapter is gigantic and travelers would need extra space for it. Adjusting to the sim tray and external memory or sim option could prove challenging. Bluetooth sound with wireless Samsung neck band wasn't so great. Sound vibrates while taking a video call. You should lower it to avoid spoiling the speakers. Not comfortable to carry with you while doing a workout. The phone came with a transparent cover.",11 January 2023
764,5.0,It's worth the money,"Well, wherever I have looked at the review of this phone, I have came across a lot of bad mouthing for sure - especially in comparison to the phones from Realme or Xiaomi.What I felt the reason for that is, the 1+ branding. People are judging this phone based on the brand image of 1+ and the expectations are pretty high. But if you consider this one from the standpoint of pure pricing, I think you'll find yourself on some reasonable ground.Reasons for me to go with this one -1) Needed good RAM and internal memory.2) Pretty good Camera performance was needed. (Stock camera app is not great, so side loaded G cam & desired result has been achieved)3) Needed clean UI. Cannot tolerate advertising and bloatwares. (Biggest reason for me to not go for Xiaomi or Realme)4) Guaranteed 2 upcoming Android updates and security updates for 3 years.5) Very good battery, with ultra fast 33W charging.Not a gamer. So didn't care for that aspect.Occasion reading will be done on the phone. Good display in that aspect. 90Hz or 120Hz doesn't personally make a difference to me. So...Call quality (clear quality & no drops, good Bluetooth TWS connections) is good.I am such a user, who do not go in to the minute details when using a phone. A phone serves these above said purposes for me. I do not care if the fingerprint reader has a 0.1 micro second delay that some other brand!! So, this one ticks all the boxes.To make my POV clear, I am someone who do not find sense in spending huge amount of money on a 6 inch phone, which you will use for YouTube and Instagram. But at the same time I am someone who will favour paying good money on productive devices like an iPad or a MacBook depending on the utility of the same. It all boils down to what you want out of the device. Do not follow the crowd. Choose as per your UTILITY.",16 December 2022

776,3.0,Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",28 February 2022

825,2.0,Android Auto Doesn't Work || UPI Apps don't work on Roaming,"Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.Severely disappointed.",8 November 2022

¬†To give you a gist of the review, overall, the phone is 9.5/10.I'll talk about the specifics in this detailed review which shall give you the complete detailed aspect of the phone.1. DisplayThe display is quite vibrant. Brightness is great even in sunlight. Watching movies on netflix would be fun for you. Refresh rate of 90Hz works as a charm. Overall you won't find any issues with it.2. Processor & RamI have played quite decent games on it. Have run parallel apps at a single time. Couldn't find any lag in with this processor.3. BatteryYour phone charges from 20-100% in just 32 Mins. This 65 W charges is practically a blessing. I have screen time of around 6 hours. The battery lasts 24 hours very easily.4. CameraI don't use much of the camera but it is quite Okayish. Won't say excellent but will do the work.The front camera is quite good.5. Design & BodyThere is a little chin on the bottom of the phone which does not affect much to me but could have been improved. The back silver metallic finish bothers a lot as it shines like a mirror. Also, you will have small dots on the backpanel surface overtime. A cover can be used to minimise this effect. The only reason I reduced 0.5 in my rating is the back panel of the cellphone.6. Operating SystemLoved the operating System, pretty smooth, aesthetically pleasant, charm for your eyes.Overall this phone is a gem. You can always go for it.",16 September 2022
1079,4.0,Disappointed.,This is my first 1+ mobile but frankly this is not the worthy which I think. Battery also running very fast and camera quality is also not much better. Overall the performance is below average and definitely you will regret after buy this. You can get much better Mobile even at the cheaper price than this one. At the end personally I have not recommend anyone to buy this Mobile.,2 December 2022

1131,4.0,One Plus is Brand,I am writing this after one complete month of usgae of phone.The phone is a good midranger one if you get it under 20 K using the exchange offer and card one too but not worth it if you get it for 24 K .If you are going to invest 24 K then go for Realme GT Master Edition Or Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g Or Realme 9 Pro 5g Or Iqoo Phones or Samsung M series phones.The Pros AreThe Processor is very good in this range and have multibands 5g.It has a 90 HZ Amoled (Good) Display.The OS is very nice.The Battery üîã stays long and is accomplished by 65 watt charger which makes it much more valuable.It can have memory card as well have two sims which is amazing.ConsThe Camera üì∏ is not up to the mark as one hopes one plus will give.It lacks the the one plus slider.Overall it's a good choice for 20 K.,28 March 2022

And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered.

Absolutely stunning camera, Oxygen OS optimises the apps to perfectly that background apps don't drain your battery.

1341,5.0,"performance and value under Rs 20,000. But is OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G worth the money","The 6.59-inch LCD display comes with 1080√ó2412 pixels and 401 PPI pixel density. The phone offers a 20:9 aspect ratio and a 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus has tried to balance it out with support for a 120Hz refresh rate display. But that doesn‚Äôt take the focus away from the display being dull from some of the rivals in the segment. Coming back to the display performance, the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G offers smooth animations, all thanks to the higher refresh rate. Mind you that the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G packs a higher refresh rate than what we get on the OnePlus Nord CE 2, which is a bit costly.We had a good time using the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G display as it supported HD content on popular OTT apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The panel is bright and offers swift colours. Though, we have to admit that it missed the punchiness of an AMOLED panel.Overall, it strikes a balance of an inferior panel and a fast refresh rate which should work well for most users in this price segment.",17 May 2022

I had requested an exchange for my old samsung device. I had an 4400 off the purchase price. But the delivery agent rejected the phone exchange.

1433,5.0,It's a great phone to buy!,"So it's been about a week that I am using this phone and I don't regret buying it. Its 90 Hz refresh rate is so smooth. Got two security patch updates too in a week which is really a great thing.The camera is really good. The phone looks premium and is lightweight and slim. It feels good in hand.Even though the speaker is mono firing speaker and not stereo speakers, it really is very loud. The screen is beautiful and there's Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the front and back.Now, coming to the battery, it easily lasts a whole day and it charges real quick and you're ready to use it whole day (100% battery)after just 35-40 mins of charge.I do casual gaming (BGMI and COD) and I didn't find any lag or jitter.

Single call can not be made smoothly every screen touch automatically pressed because of proximity sensor issues and you can not make a single call without having this issues.  Some timea it goes mute automatically and sometimes starts calling another number  because screen gets on due to proximity sensor issueI am fed up using this mobile .Don't waste your hard earned money on brand so called one plus .. very very tarriable experience",18 May 2023

1504,5.0,I don't see anything wrong with it. It's just a good phone. Delivery was shite though!,"This was my first phone above 20k, and tbh, it's not bad. I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!  Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. It gets the job done fast, and comes with a boatload of features too.",6 April 2022

1520,5.0,Best budget phone at this price!!!!,"This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use. Mind that it was always on 90hz mode.Overall package is good and i'm totally satisfied with it.",14 March 2022

Camera also average not like anyone can expect from a OnePlus phone.Indisplay fingerprint and face lock are not fast as other brand phones.Charging is fast, but if you use a little bit while charging the speed will reduce automatically to 50watts. Only charging while phone switched off will give you proper speed.I have attached one screenshot, see in that screenshot it is showing in notification that charging is complete but in the top battery indicator it is showing 82%. Like this many other bugs are there. Hope OnePlus will eliminate all such bugs in next update as it comes with a old Android version 11 and latest is Android 12. It's just one weeks of usage and there's a lot of issues don't know where to report.Thanks for reading. This is my honest review on this device.",29 April 2022

I agree it's a low and budget phone but still had better expectations.Pros: great feel in hand looks premium, Great battery and charging is like awesome. Sound is loud and brightness is also good. Videos look awesome. Touch is great, processor is üëåüèªCons: not a gaming phone you'll be disappointed with that. Camera isn't that good at all. Body is plastic, speaker location makes it not audible with texting.

I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.",28 May 2022

1688,2.0,Terrible Camera with average battery life!,"Camera: 1/5 ratingCamera is terrible! I don't usually use camera at all. So, I don't have huge expectations on that department. Yet, it managed to go below those minimum expectations as well. The camera is way below the quality of redmi note 11 (my previous phone) and you can't even install gcam as it's mediatek processor in Nord ce 2.Battery: Charges fast and discharges quickly as well. I can give 3/5 rating as it charges under 30 minutes by compensating the average battery backup.Display: 3/5 ratingIt doesn't seem like a high quality display. I think redmi note 11's (my previous phone) amoled display is better and brighter than this. But, It is an amoled display after all, you can expect good contrast, punchy colours in Nord ce 2 as well.Performance: 4/5 ratingNo lag, No heat, Works very well in day to day tasks. Gaming is also good for heavy gamers but just don't compare it with flagship phones.Speaker: loud and clear but its only a single speaker.",19 November 2022

Zoom level is only 6x.Video lags too much while recording and playing, the microphone levels are so unadjusted.If you were thinking of buying this for camera, just back off and get something else.Now coming to the networks, this phone has a lot of problems with it. Networks keeps dropping in between, you won't even know if you miss any important call or communication because of this.I thought this is only limited to my set, but after seeing the reviews seems like this device model has this problem.Once you restart phone, it works for some time but again the issue starts to happen.
